# Description
This is a loan management framework developed for the Detailed Software Design class at Digital Metropole Institute.
For this class, I had previously developed a full stack application using the same tech stack as this one, that project is in one
of my repositories, the project is "Biblicron-FullStack-Application". So the last unity assignemnt was to turn that application into a
general purpose framework, in my case the purpose was loaning management, so I had to turn the application into a loan management framework that could be used by anyone to make their applications.

For this, I had to use some Design Patterns that we learned at the class and also the SOLID principles. The Framework part is only the back-end, the Professor said that the front-end would just be a plus, but I did it anyway.

# Note

I had to make three instances of the framework to prove it working for the assignemnt, so you'll find all three of them in this same project, because I had to make it easier to my Professor to see all of them. But, if you want to, you can only take the core and build your own application.
